# TSNN-P: Temporal Spatial Navigation Network for Jetson Nano

Optimized for Jetson Nano 8GB with JetPack 6.2, this repository implements the TSNN-P framework for consciousness-driven spacetime navigation.

## Prerequisites

- Jetson Nano 8GB Developer Kit
- JetPack 6.2 installed
- Docker installed (`jetson-containers` compatible)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tsnn_p.git
   cd tsnn_p
   ```
2. Build the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker build -t tsnn_p:latest .
   ```
3. Run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run --runtime nvidia -it tsnn_p:latest
   ```

## Usage

Run the main navigation pipeline:
```bash
python tsnn_p/main.py
```

Run unit tests:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

## Modules

- `navigation.py`: Hyperdimensional path optimization
- `consciousness.py`: EEG-driven stress-energy tensor
- `higgs.py`: Kagome lattice for Higgs condensate
- `wormhole.py`: AdS/CFT and LENR simulation
- `ethics.py`: Ethical safeguards via entropy constraints

## Validation Metrics

- Navigation: Path calculation latency < 50ms
- Consciousness: Gamma detection accuracy > 95%
- Higgs: Coherence time > 1ns (simulated)
- Wormhole: Energy reduction > 40% via AdS/CFT
- Ethics: False positive rate < 1%

## Key Optimizations for Jetson Nano

- **CuPy for GPU Acceleration**: Replaces GASNETx Fypy, leveraging Jetson Nano's CUDA cores for path integrals and matrix operations.
- **Lightweight Dependencies**: Uses NumPy and SciPy instead of heavy libraries, fitting within 8GB RAM.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Ensures reproducibility using `jetson-containers` base images.
- **Simplified Algorithms**: Reduces computational complexity (e.g., lite Hamiltonian in `higgs.py`) to avoid thermal throttling.
- **Ethical Safeguards**: Maintains causality enforcement with minimal overhead.

## Deployment Instructions

1. Flash Jetson Nano with JetPack 6.2 using NVIDIA SDK Manager.
2. Install Docker and pull `jetson-containers` dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install docker.io
   docker pull dustynv/scipy:r6.2
   ```
3. Clone and build the repository as per README instructions.
4. Run the container with GPU access:
   ```bash
   docker run --runtime nvidia -it tsnn_p:latest
   ```

## Notes

- The speculative nature of TSNN-P (e.g., Higgs condensate, wormhole stabilization) is implemented as simulations, focusing on mathematical fidelity rather than physical realization.
- EEG data is simulated; for real-world use, integrate with OpenBCI or similar hardware via USB.
- The repository is designed for research and educational purposes, inspiring curiosity in quantum mechanics, neuroscience, and computational physics.
